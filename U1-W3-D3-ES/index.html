                <h4>
                    Founded in 1893, it is the longest-running of the Italian clubs still in business as well as one of
                    the
                    most noble, boasting in its roll of honor 9 league titles won between 1898 - the first ever in the
                    history of Italian football - and 1923-1924: this series of successes earned Genoa the definition of
                    the
                    first great national football, a role exercised until the pre-war period, and ensured that for its
                    first
                    sixty years it established itself as the most successful Italian team, alone or shared, before being
                    overtaken by Juventus at the end of the second post-war period.

                    "I can't write about Genoa because I'm too involved. I don't do the hymn because I don't like
                    marches
                    and because nothing can overcome the choirs of the Northern Steps. If anything at Genoa I would have
                    written a love song, but I don't do it because to make songs you have to keep a certain detachment
                    from
                    what you write, instead Genoa involves me too much."
